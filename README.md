## Fighting the Invasive Spotted Lanternfly using Machine Learning

### VIP Research Program
Spring 2021 Repository for all Image Analysis code written (Streamlit/Heroku web-app, Python webscrapper, HPC bash scripts, ML models).

I contributed towards leveraging GPU Processing for Machine Learning models in a High-Performance Computing (HPC) environment. See extensive [docs](https://github.com/abejeyapratap/LanternFly-HPC/tree/main/HPC#high-performance-computing--gpu-processing)
